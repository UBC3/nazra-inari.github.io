title: Creating a blog using GitHub for FREE
---

Creating a blog post got a lot easier thanks to GitHub.

* Simply fork a working jekyll theme to your GitHub repository.
* Clone the repository to your local computer to make easy updates
* Edit the "_congfig.yml" file in your root folder
* Add posts by navigating to the /_posts folder and then creating a blog post by using the "+" button.
* Make sure to include the [front-matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) block at the beginning of each post. That helps you Github process YAML files specially.
* Lastly, make sure the post's filename is in this format: year-month-day-title.md
